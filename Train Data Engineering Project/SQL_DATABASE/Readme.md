ðŸš† Train Data Engineering Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing train schedule data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly). It is designed as a step-by-step Data Engineering workflow that progresses from basic exploration to advanced insights and reporting.

The dataset contains information about trains, their source/destination stations, and operating days. Through this project, we apply data wrangling, transformation, and analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights about train operations and scheduling patterns.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The tasks are organized into four levels:

Level 1: Data Exploration and Basic Operations

Task 1.1: Load dataset, inspect first 10 rows, check structure, data types, and missing values.

Task 1.2: Compute basic statistics:

Number of trains

Unique source and destination stations

Most common source/destination stations

Task 1.3: Data cleaning:

Handle missing values

Standardize station names (uppercase formatting)

Level 2: Data Transformation and Aggregation

Task 2.1:

Filter trains operating on specific days (e.g., Saturdays).

Extract trains starting from a given station.

Task 2.2:

Group by source station â†’ count trains originating from each.

Calculate average number of trains per day per station.

Task 2.3: Add a new column categorizing trains by operating days â†’ Weekday / Weekend.

Level 3: Advanced Data Analysis

Task 3.1: Pattern analysis:

Distribution of train journeys across the week.

Visualization using bar plots & histograms.

Identify trends in source/destination operations.

Task 3.2: Correlation and insights:

Explore relation between train frequency and days of the week.

Provide actionable insights for scheduling and operations.

Level 4: Data Visualization and Reporting

Task 4.1: Create clear visualizations:

Bar charts â†’ number of trains per station

Line charts â†’ day-wise distribution

Heatmaps â†’ train density trends

Task 4.2: Reporting:

Comprehensive summary of findings

Data cleaning/transformation process

Insights & recommendations for stakeholders
